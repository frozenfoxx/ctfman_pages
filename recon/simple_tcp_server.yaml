title: Simple TCP Server
description: Use netcat to open a simple tcp server to catch shells, text, exfiltrated data, etc. If you intend to use this on a port below 1024 (i.e. port 80,443) you will need to run it as root.
command: nc -k -l 8080
function: |
  function ctfman_tcp_server() {
    $(which nc) -k -l "$1"
  }
params:
  - -k -- Forces nc to stay listening for another connection after its current connection is completed
  - -l -- Listen on <port>
